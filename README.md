Just bad code, make fun of it if you want, I wonâ€™t be offended.

Originally made back in school 4 years ago. I made the gameplay as repetitive and annoying as possible so I could annoy the teacher just as much as they annoyed the students.
And before I knew classes were a thing...

If you credit me just link to my github homepage as apposed to the bad code pls!
